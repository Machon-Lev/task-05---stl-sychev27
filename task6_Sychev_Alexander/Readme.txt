To fulfill these requirements, the following choice are made:

Vector for city storage: A std::vector was selected to store the cities.
This choice offers efficient random access by index, which is crucial for searching cities based on indices.
Additionally, vectors provide dynamic resizing capabilities to accommodate adding or removing cities during program execution.

The rationale behind this choice is to optimize the program for search operations,
where users can search for cities using different criteria. The vector provides efficient storage and dynamic resizing.
